Objective - 
Understand what makes a password strong and test it using an online password strength checker.

Tool Used
- [passwordmonster.com](https://www.passwordmonster.com/)

Passwords Tested
1. `password123` — Weak (Low score, no symbols or uppercase)
2. `Password123` — Medium (Added uppercase letter)
3. `P@ssw0rd123!` — Strong (Symbols, numbers, upper & lower case)
4. 
5. `T1m3$Are#Ch@ng1ng!` — Very Strong (Complex, long, unpredictable)

Key Learnings
- Strong passwords include:
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Numbers and special symbols
  - Length of at least 12 characters
  - Avoiding dictionary words or patterns
- Weak passwords often use:
  - Common phrases or keyboard patterns (e.g., `123456`, `qwerty`)
  - No symbol/number variety
- Password strength matters because:
  - Strong passwords resist brute-force attacks by increasing possible combinations
  - They are less predictable and harder to guess using dictionary lists

Best Practices
- Use a password manager to store complex passwords
- Do not reuse passwords across accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible
